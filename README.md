# Kotlin LibGDX Quickstart Project

This project serves as a launching point for LibGDX projects written in Kotlin. 

## KTX Libraries

This project comes packaged with KTX extension libraries. These serve to smooth some of the rougher interactions between
LibGDX and Kotlin, as well as providing some quality-of-life utilities such as lightweight dependency injection. 

If you decide not to use any of these libraries, feel free to remove them from the root build.gradle file.

> No HTML5 project?

From the LibGDX wiki page on Kotlin:

"Due to how GWT works, you will not be able to use the HTML5 target with Kotlin. This could be fixed in the future by 
using Kotlinâ€™s JavaScript back-end. It might be possible to utilize [TeaVM](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm) as a 
replacement for GWT, though."
